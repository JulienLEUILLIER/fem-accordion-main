## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

:v: Second FrontEndMentor challenge completed !<br/>
I complicated things at first by trying to make the images responsive in size with the screen width, to be able to have a flexible width for mobile.
I ended up just leaving a fixed size but learned some [awesome ways](https://adrienzaganelli.com/blog/time-saving-css-techniques-to-create-responsive-images/) to get responsive images !
I also tried to implement BEM to get some, I think, clean and maintainable SCSS code.

### Acknowledgments

- [HTML inspiration](https://github.com/vanzasetia/faq-accordion-card) - I looked at other solutions after completing the project and this one was very exhaustive, lots of HTML tags I didn't know about, and general good code quality.
